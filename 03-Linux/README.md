# Dev Installation - Linux Setup

#### How to get a Linux machine if you don't have one?

```
FYI... I have a MacBook and plan on working on a Ubuntu Machine

Download Ubuntu Desktop image from Ubuntu website
Install VirtualBox
Create a New Virtual Machine
When you run the virtual machine, it'll ask for the image path. Point it to the Ubuntu image.
You'll be able to setup your virtual machine as similar as having a brand new hardware installing the OS
You'll be able to setup login credentials as well
Once done, setup will ask for a restart of the machine. You're all set to use your Ubuntu machine!!
```
