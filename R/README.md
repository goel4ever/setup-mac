# R

##### Installation

```
> brew tap homebrew/science
> brew install R

You will probably also want to install a few of Hadley Wickham’s packages
> R                            // Launches R
    > install.packages("ggplot2")
    > install.packages("dplyr")
    > install.packages("tidyr")
```

##### Install RStudio

```
RStudio is relatively lightweight and runs without using too much system resources

Download and install from:
https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/#Desktop
```

##### Install MacTex

```
To export Rmarkdown documents as PDFs, to share analyses with colleagues, RStudio requires MacTeX. The installer for
the full version of MacTeX is giant (~3GB), but worth it if you plan to share your work as a PDF. Unless you’re
experienced with MacTeX, go with the full MacTeX installation rather than BasicTeX. 

Download and install from:
https://tug.org/mactex/
