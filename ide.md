# Integrated Development Environment \(IDE\)

You can choose to code in whatever you want, even in a text editor. IDEs are a set of tools that assist developers in handy-daily operations like folder management, syntax highlighting, auto-complete \(Intellisense\), quick find files or text, shortcut for certain steps of operations, Git integration, debugging, execution, linting, formatting, and a lot more.

#### Factors to choose an IDE

* Language support
  * Being a developer these days can require you to switch between multiple languages. I personally prefer an IDE that has support for a most of the languages I code in. There is no point flooding your system memory with multiple installations.
* Cost
  * Free is best. However if I have to pay few bucks to get something that can stay with me longer, I would be happy to spend that money. I do not like being dependent on an organization to fund me for an IDE, not that I don't like free money, but I intend to reduce wasting time on switching between platforms. It is important for me to have a similar coding platform, wherever I go, for the sake of speed and productivity. I believe, so should be important for you.
* Light-weight
  * This is not a must have feature, however, again, I prefer having a light-weight IDE. This frees up space for other runnign system intensive application, or other scenario would be when I need to open multiple workspaces, my system resources are better used in the work instead of supporting the IDE.
* Plugin-support
  * When it comes to IDEs, there is no one answer to everything, however a lot of features these days can be added via plugins. Also some may not like the heavy-lifting of plugins to be forced upon, instead you only add when you need it. A smart way of managing your local system limitations. Factoring all this in, it is important to look at this aspect, if an IDE has growing support for plugins too. `Beware:` do not install a whole lot of plugins out of love of functionality. You'll end up defeating the purpose of having a light-weight IDE. Keep a list of must-have, need-to-have and good-to-have.
* Multi-platform support
  * I myself had to switch between different operating systems in my career. Its not easy when you have been working on one operating system for years. Atleast having one familiar application \(the IDE\) can get you going than waiting to figure out everything. This can get overwhelming, depending on needs of your job.
* Git integration
  * I don't think about not working on Git. Its' the de-facto standard these days. I prefer learning command line operations, however sometimes, it doesn't hurt having these inbuilt in your tool to handle some of the tasks for you when you really need it.
* Debugging
  * Apart from code organization, debugging is extremely important to be supported by an IDE. No one writes perfect code \(or I should say, not always\). Figure out how it is done in the tool of your choice and you are all set.
* Intellisense
  * Syntax highlighting
  * Auto-completion - Don't be too dependent on it, however to pick up speed in this work, it is an important feature to have in your toolbox
