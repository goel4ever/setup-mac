# Mac OSX Setup

Everything you need to know about given technologies to get started with developing applications locally. Goal of writing this book is to documenting about 90% of the setup issues that we normally come across and have them be least of our problems.

This book also acts as a reference guide to common commands. You may or may not have the latest and greatest development machine, however this book is going to help you jump right in and start working without basic issues.

> Source of inspiration: I've been writing a single book about everything for a while. The idea of breaking down the book into smaller components came from running across Kyle Simpson's book called "You don't know JS". I really liked the idea, its neat, manageable. Hence this book.
